# Scientific Activity

Recently, in most developed countries, the management of science has changed and today the
development of indicators to objectively evaluate the results of scientific activity is very relevant. This is
a useful tool for analyzing trends and the basis for management for determining the prospects of
scientific areas, the need to continue funding research. Scientific publication is one of the forms of
presenting research results, which has traditionally used as an indicator of the performance of scientific
activity.

Organization of accounting for the publication work of employees is necessary in every scientific
institution.

Currently, scientific publications of most research organizations are recorded through the annual
collection of information in simple text documents. Such a system does not allow receiving operational
information for each employee and departments. Information processing is also complicated by the
special rules of the bibliographic description of publications, which require the participation of a
specialist in bibliography.

The application allows you to create a base that contains all scientific publications in research
organization. The base allows you to keep track of publications in certain categories (articles,
monographs, theses, etc.), and can also be quickly adjusted by a specialist in bibliography and is
available for use by both employees and managers.

The application also allows you to obtain information on the publication activity of individual employees
and departments and can be used as one of the criteria for the performance of scientific work, in
determining the ability of performers to solve specific scientific problems, in selecting performers for
implementing new research projects and forming research plans, as criteria transfer to higher positions
in the company and personification of scientific employees promotion.

Planning and implementation of the project was carried out in close cooperation with potential users,
which allowed us to take into account real needs and apply solutions that allow using this service in the
real work of research organizations.

Architecture of the application provide opportunities to include other indicators of the performance of
scientific activity: intellectual property objects, presentations at scientific and practical events, expert
work, etc.
